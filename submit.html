        <h1>Submissions</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Charles Carter submission page – we’re glad to see that
          you’re considering sending us your work! We charge no fee for
          submission, read all work submitted to us, and provide detailed
          feedback on everything we read whether it is accepted or rejected. We
          only ask that you abide by our guidelines of submission; if you do not
          we unfortunately cannot guarantee your piece will be read simply due
          to the high volume of submissions we receive.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are sure that your work is typo free and formatted correctly
          please submit it in the appropriate section below!
        </p>

        <h1>Writing</h1>
        <p>
          Thank you for considering a submission to our publication. We
          appreciate your continued interest and support. If you’re wondering
          whether you should submit or not, wonder no more. Submit.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don’t care if you write short stories, poetry, non fiction,
          medieval sonnets, or Doctor Who fanfic. If it’s written, and people
          want to read it, we want it in our submission box. So if this is your
          first time submitting to a publication, don’t let things like being
          “literary” or “good” stress you out. Give it a whirl! We also accept
          reprints, so if you’ve got published work you’d like to see published
          again, have at it. Just click submit. And remember, whether your piece
          is accepted or rejected, we will send you back a list of detailed
          feedback!
        </p>
        <h3>Guidelines</h3>
        <p>
          If your work exceeds 5,000 words please submit using the Long Piece
          submission form. This ensures that your work is read in a more timely
          manner and reduces confusion for the coordinators within Charles
          Carter. Please follow these guidelines to ensure we are able to read
          your piece: if the format differs too greatly from what we ask for we
          will unfortunately be unable to consider your submission for
          publication simply due to the large volume of works we receive.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Submit as PDF</li>
          <li>Number the pages</li>
          <li>
