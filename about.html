        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Dear Reader,</h2>
        <p>
          The Charles Carter is an online literary magazine composed of
          submissions from writers from many places and backgrounds. Every
          submission is read all the way through in a workshop setting, and it
          is our aim to provide authors with thoughtful feedback, independent of
          whether we decide to publish the piece or not. Our goal is not to
          accept only the most rigorous and elite of writing, but rather to
          provide a platform for writers of all varieties. This is not to say
          that there are no barriers to entry: Every submission must pass
          through an intensive review session and closed vote before
          publication. However, we are not a magazine that will ever reach that
          fabled &lt;1% acceptance ratio, nor would we ever want to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our staff is composed of a diverse group of students at UNC-Chapel
          Hill from various areas of study so that we may analyze submitted
          works considering many points of view and preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to read. We want to listen. Bring us the misfits, your
          experimentsâ€“your reprints and rejects. Bring us the old flames, new
          works, those pieces with ghost of lingering grip. Bring us the words
          of your pen and the thoughts in your head. Bring to us so that we may
          know you, and to your writing bring home.
        </p>
